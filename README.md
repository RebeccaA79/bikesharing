# Bike Sharing Analysis

## OVERVIEW
### Purpose:  The purpose of the following analysis is to prepare visualizations that give potential investors an overview of NYC's Citibike bike-sharing program, and determine if the program would be sucessful in Des Moines as well. To help make thiis determination, the following visualizations have been prepared: 
1) Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, 
2) Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and 
3) Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.


## RESULTS
#### The full results of the analysis have been published on into on Tableau Public. (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rebecca.allison/viz/BikesharingAnalysis_ModuleChallenge/BikeSharingAnalysisStory?publish=yes)


 - Based on Checkout Times for Users line chart, the majority of rides are less than one hour with peak usage around 5 minutes.

- Checkout Times by Gender follows a similar pattern in trip length to the Checkout Times by Users with most trips lasting under 20 minutes. Males do hold a much larger proportion of rides in comparison to females and unknown.

- The Trips by Weekday per Hour heat map shows that bike usage is heaviest on weekdays during commuting times (Between 7am and 8am and between 5pm and 6pm). On weekends, the bike usage is heavier during the day with Saturday being the busiest day. Peak usage appears to be between late morning and early afternoon.

- The Trips by Gender (per Weekday and hour) heat map shows a similar pattern as the heat map above, regardless of gender. As shown in the 2nd line chart above, males do hold the largest share of rides.

 - The 'User Trips by Gender by Weekday' heatmap shows most subscribers are male and hold most of the weekday activity.  The customers' gender is often unknown and usage on the weekend is more evenly split between subscribers and customers.

 - The Average Trip Duration by Age shows that in general, the younger the person the longer the bike ride.

 - The gender breakdown pie chart shows that males hold the most usage of bike rides. This information could be useful in exploring further and how to increase marketshare among women.

## SUMMARY
### The results of this analysis have given insight into the utilization and sucess of NYC's Citibike bike-sharing program. There are definite patterns of usage based on time of day, time of week, age, and gender which should collectivly be considered. Weekday useage is heavily concentrated around the morning and afternoon commute times while weekend useage is more evenly spread through the day but starts later in the morning.  I recommend further analysis for a few points.  Firstly, while we've seen that the vast majority of trips are 30 min or less, we should perform further analysis to compare weekend trip durations to weekday trip durations and see how those differ.  Additionally, there should be further investigation into why males are more likley to utilize the bike ride shasre program and hopefully gain more interest from females.
